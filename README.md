# Django Blog App

A django based application with user authentication system and capabilities like uploading post along with thumnails which are to be stored in aws s3 storage.
There is always a room for improvement.

Future plans/features to implement: 
1. Provide more flexibility to users
2. Put up worthy content 
3. List doesn't stop but works at a slow pace

To use this project, fork --> clone it to your system --> run `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>

Now create .env file and mention credentials of your aws s3 bucket and postgresql database.

Once it is done, run your server using `python manage.py runserver` <br>

This Project was hosted on heroku so if you also want to host it then follow it's documentation and you can do so very easily. <br>

Feel free to modify this.

### Hope you like this work. Cheers to you all developers.
