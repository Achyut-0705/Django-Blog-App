# Student-Management-System

A django based application with user authentication system and capabilities like uploading post along with thumnails which are to be stored in aws s3 storage.
There is always a room for improvement.

Future plans/features to implement: 
1. Expand database and provide more flexibility to users
2. Put up worthy content 
3. List doesn't stop but works at a slow pace


Feel free to fork this and modify. Cheers to developers community. Always
