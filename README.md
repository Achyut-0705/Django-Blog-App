# Library-Management-System

A django based application with user authentication system and capabilities like uploading post along with thumnails which are to be stored in aws s3 storage.
There is always a room for improvement.

Future plans/features to implement: 
1. Expand database and provide more flexibility to users
2. Put up worthy content 
3. List doesn't stop but works at a slow pace

To use this project, run following command on terminal
`pip install django-storages`

`pip install boto3`

Now clone this repo and insert your s3 credentials in .env file

Feel free to fork this and modify. Cheers to developers community. Always
